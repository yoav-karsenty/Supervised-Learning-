# Supervised Learning
In this project,my goal is to predict whether a customer will leave Beta Bank soon. I have the data on clientsâ€™ past 
behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.

I want to:
1. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. In this project, my threshold for F1 score will be 0.59 
2. Additionally, i will measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score.

# Skills demonstrated 
1. Data preparation and analysis using pandas and matplotlib
2. Data splitting using sklearn.model_selection
3. model training and adjustments using RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression model from sklearn.ensemble and sklearn.linear_model
4. Balancing models classes
